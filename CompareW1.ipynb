        "We made one modification to the previous code block, and that is adding an`elif` statement. `elif` is short for 'else if', and represents the alternate condition in this short example. Python first checks to see if the first condition holds `true`. If not, it checks the alternate condition(s). This second check ONLY happens if the first condition does not hold true. In this case, Python will just run down the list of conditions until it finds a condition that holds true, or gets to the `else` statement. You can have as many `elif` statements as necessary, but Python will only choose to run the code under the first elif statement that is true. \n",
